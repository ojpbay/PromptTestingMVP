# Feature Specification: Prompt Testing MVP

**Feature Branch**: `001-the-prompt-testing`  
**Created**: September 4, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "The Prompt Testing MVP is a simplified interface that allows users to quickly test and validate data extraction prompts against insurance documents within specific business scopes. This specification defines the minimum viable product for prompt testing functionality."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user wants to quickly validate a data extraction prompt against insurance documents within a specific business scope. The user selects the scope, chooses a prompt, edits the context, runs the test, and reviews the results.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** all scope fields are selected, **When** the user applies the scope, **Then** the prompt list is displayed for that scope.
2. **Given** a prompt is selected, **When** the user edits the context and runs the test, **Then** the system executes the test and displays accuracy and last run date.
3. **Given** the context is empty, **When** the user tries to run the test, **Then** the run button is disabled.
4. **Given** a test is running, **When** the user tries to start another, **Then** the system prevents multiple simultaneous executions.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the user selects an invalid scope combination? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What constitutes an invalid combination?]
- How does the system handle test execution errors? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Error feedback mechanism not specified]
- What if the document repository is unavailable? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Fallback or error handling not specified]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST require all four scope fields to be selected before prompts are accessible.
- **FR-002**: System MUST display prompts in a table with required metadata (name, version, data point, status, accuracy).
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow selection of a single prompt for testing.
- **FR-004**: System MUST auto-populate context when a prompt is selected.
- **FR-005**: System MUST require non-empty context before test execution.
- **FR-006**: System MUST execute tests against all documents in the selected scope.
- **FR-007**: System MUST display test results (accuracy, last run date) after execution.
- **FR-008**: System MUST prevent multiple simultaneous test executions per user session.
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide immediate feedback on test execution status.
- **FR-010**: System MUST support scope pre-population via URL parameters.
- **FR-011**: System MUST allow users to clear and reselect scope.
- **FR-012**: System MUST persist scope selection during session.
- **FR-013**: System MUST display status badges for prompt states (active, draft, archived).
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide basic metrics storage for results.
- **FR-015**: System MUST require user authentication for access.
- **FR-016**: System MUST log test executions for audit purposes.
- **FR-017**: System MUST NOT allow prompt creation or editing in MVP. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is prompt editing completely excluded or only restricted?]

### Key Entities
- **Scope**: Represents the business context for prompt testing. Attributes: team, brokingSegment, globalLineOfBusiness, product.
- **Prompt**: Represents a data extraction prompt. Attributes: id, name, version, dataPoint, status, accuracy, lastRun.
- **Context**: Represents the editable instructions for a prompt. Attributes: promptId, content.
- **TestResult**: Represents the outcome of a test execution. Attributes: accuracy, completedAt.
